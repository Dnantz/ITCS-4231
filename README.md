## Instructions
  Your goal is to clear the rooms of enemies as fast as possible as the time ticks down. Damaging and killing enemies rewards you with more time, while taking damage will cost you some time. Each level randomies the layout of the rooms and ramps up the speed of the game. As time scales up, your reflexes will have to keep up.
## Controls
  Basic movement with WASD and Spacebar, with other movement controls listed on-screen. Pick up weapons with E. There are two kinds of weapons: assault rifles and shotguns. Aim and shoot with the mouse, reload with R.
 ## Goal
  Score comes from how much time is left on the clock once the entire floor is cleared of enemies. The minimap will display the room as green once all the enemies in it are killed. The game keeps ramping up in scale until you can no longer keep up.
## Cheats
  [K] to kill all enemies in the current room  
  [N] to skip to the next level
